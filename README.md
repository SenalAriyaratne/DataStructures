# Data Structures in Python

## Overview

This repository is a work in progress that aims to provide implementations of various data structures in Python. It is designed to help developers, students, and enthusiasts understand and use different data structures with ease.

### Current Implementation:
- **Doubly Linked List**: A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node has two references: one to the next node and another to the previous node, allowing for bidirectional traversal.

### TODO (Upcoming Data Structures):
- **Singly Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **Heap**
- **Graph (Adjacency List and Matrix)**
- **Hash Table**

All implementations will be designed with simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use in mind, adhering to Pythonic principles and coding best practices.
